# 🔐 Random Password Generator

A sleek and simple **Random Password Generator** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Instantly create secure, randomized passwords for your accounts, projects, or applications with ease.

---

## 📌 Overview

The Password Generator produces random combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols to help users generate strong and unpredictable passwords. It’s lightweight, efficient, and perfect for beginners learning about randomization, strings, and JavaScript fundamentals.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔡 Generates random passwords on page load or refresh
- 🔒 Securely mixes uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters
- ⚡ Fast, lightweight, and fully client-side
- 🧠 Easy to customize (e.g., change password length, include/exclude character types)
- 🖥️ Minimal and clean codebase

## 📁 Project Structure

```
random-password-generator/
│
├── index.html      # HTML setup for loading JavaScript
├── style.css       # Styles for enhancing the visual UI
└── index.js        # JavaScript logic to generate random passwords
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The script uses predefined character sets (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, special characters).
- A loop randomly selects characters based on the desired password length.
- The generated password is displayed to the user.

Example JavaScript logic:
```javascript
const chars = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()";
let password = "";
for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    password += chars[Math.floor(Math.random() * chars.length)];
}
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Basic page setup
- **CSS3** – Styling for better visuals (optional)
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Core password generation logic

---

## 🖥️ How to Run Locally

1. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd random-password-generator
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.

3. The password will generate automatically (or with button trigger if UI is added).

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- ✏️ Allow users to choose password length
- 🔢 Option to toggle inclusion of numbers or symbols
- 🎨 Add user interface to copy password to clipboard
- 📱 Improve mobile responsiveness and styling
- 🔁 Add a "Generate New Password" button without page reload
